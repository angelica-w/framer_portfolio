The platform was built on 3 separate products (Auctions, Offerings, and now Contracts), which created a confusing seller experience and technical debt. Adding a separate Contracts product would worsen these issues.","This realization prompted my project to pivot from a single feature to a full-scale strategic redesign. I worked closely with product, engineering, and design teams to redesign the platform's core architecture, merging 3 fragmented products into a single cohesive framework that creates a seamless experience for sellers and supports long-term growth for B-Stock.","the challenge","B-Stock provides a B2B marketplace for buying/selling liquidation and overstock goods.","While B-Stock was growing and building new features, the underlying product structure soon presented some major challenges. The platform was divided into 3 separate products: Auctions, Offerings, and Contracts. This fragmentation created inefficiencies for both the sellers using the platform and for B-Stock's internal teams.","Buyers place bids for a one-time inventory. Winners are decided automatically.","Buyers submit offers for a one-time inventory. Winners are chosen by the Seller.","Buyers submit bids for a recurring inventory. Winners are decided automatically.","When a seller wants to list and sell their inventory, they first have to understand the 3 distinct product types and choose the one that best fits their needs. This caused:","Uncertainty about which product best suited their inventory","Time spent learning multiple, slightly different workflows","While each product catered for different needs, their separation as distinct systems meant that sellers had to navigate and keep track of different workflows, leading to confusion and a disjointed user experience.","Internally, each product had its own separate codebase. This resulted in inefficient workflows that slowed the pace of innovation.","Any new feature, minor update, or bug fix had to be designed, developed, and tested 3 times","The need to replicate work across 3 systems delayed the launch of new, valuable features for our users","While this structure worked when there were fewer products and features, it was now no longer scalable.","the solution","To implement Contracts, the most obvious solution was to treat it as a 3rd, separate product, replicating the old platform's structure.","However, in early planning sessions with product managers, it became clear that this approach would only worsen existing problems with the overall architecture.","This prompted us to take a step back and ask a more fundamental questions: What is a \"listing\" at its most basic level?","The answer to this question was our AHA moment. Instead of thinking in terms of separate products (Auctions, Offerings, Contracts), We could define any listing using 2 simple, independent properties:","Does the inventory ship once (Spot) or on a recurring basis (Contract)","Do buyers compete via open bidding (Auction) or submit private proposals (Offering)","This new mental model reframed the 3 separate products as combinations of these settings. A classic \"Auction\" was now a \"Spot Auction.\" A \"Contract\" was a \"Contract Auction.\" This model also revealed the possibility for a new product, \"Contract Offerings,\" with almost no additional architectural complexity.","With this new mental model, sellers could simplify their workflow. The confusing choice between 3 products was replaced with a clear, 2-step decision:","First, they decide on the Listing Type: Is this a one-time sale or a recurring one?","Second, they choose a Sales Method: Do they want an open auction or private offers?","This new perspective was the key to solving some of the biggest challenges of a fragmented system. It provided a clear path towards a unified codebase for B-Stock, along with a simple, cohesive experience for sellers.","bringing the vision to life","With this new mental model established, the primary design challenge was to translate this concept into a simple and intuitive interface. The goal was to guide the user down the right path from the very beginning.","The new listing flow begins when a seller makes their 1st key decision: choosing between a Spot (one-time) or Contract (recurring) listing. This selection then prompts a modal where they make their second key choice, an Auction or Offer sales method, and fill in other initial details.","This sequential flow was intentionally designed to reduce cognitive load. By breaking down a single large decision into 2 smaller, more manageable steps, we created a guided experience that builds sellers' confidence.","Once these core choices were made, the rest of the user's journey would adapt accordingly. For example, if a seller chose a \"Contract\" listing type, they'd need to provide specific details about the contract's terms.","On the old platform, contract details were entered into messy, unstructured text fields, providing no usable data. To solve this, I had to create a design that balanced user-friendliness, engineering feasibility, and the needs of our internal listing team.","My initial design focused on structure and consistency:","I used a side model for these contract-specific details. This kept the main creation form identical for both Spot and Contract listings, simplifying the overall engineering and user experience","To enable future data analytics, I replaced the old platform's ambiguous free-form text fields with defined numeral inputs and radio buttons","To minimize disruptions for our internal listing team, the design collected the same core info they were already used to (contract duration, frequency, and load)","This 1st pass revealed some key gaps:","The team noted that specific start and end date values were required for he backend logic to function","They pointed out that for many sellers, the exact frequency and load are unknown or flexible at the time of listing","The 2nd iteration focused on incorporating the feedback to add necessary functionality and flexibility:","To satisfy the backend requirements, I added a \"Start Date\" field. To simplify data entry, the \"End Date\" was then automatically calculated based on the start date and duration","To address the listing team's feedback, I introduced checkboxes that allow sellers to mark values like \"frequency\" or \"load\" as unknown when necessary. I also added optional notes fields to give them space for important context","This version was much closer, but usability testing the the listing team revealed 2 remaining workflow issues:","They noted that contract end dates sometimes needed to be manually edited and don't always align perfectly with the duration","The predefined frequency options (e.g. weekly, monthly) weren't flexible enough for all seller scenarios","The 3rd iteration incorporated the last pieces of feedback to create a robust and flexible design:","To give the listing team the control they needed for non-standard contracts, I made the start date, duration, and end date all independently editable. This ensures the tool can handle any negotiated timeline","To solve the issue of rigid frequency options, the final design allows users to define both the quantity and the time period (e.g. \"3 shipments\" per \"2 months\"). This solution is flexible enough to accommodate any possible seller scenario","This final design successfully balanced the business's need for structured data with the flexibility required by our internal users","achievements","While the full implementation was scheduled to begin after my internship, the new framework and designs I delivered still had an immediate and clear impact:","My final presentation, which introduced the new unified model to the company, was so successful that the Head of Marketing adopted my slides for official internal material for explaining the platform's new vision.

It's difficult for them to build the habit of taking medication given their busy daily lives.","First, we created a sitemap to figure out what kind of functionality we'd need and how it should all flow and be organized.","Then, I sketched out low fidelity concepts of how users could:","add new medications","set up a reminder schedule","stay motivated to continue taking their medications","design Details","To figure out what steps are needed to add a new medication and its reminders, we created a user flow.","For setting up reminders, and aspect we especially focused on was how to input times for each round of reminders","Rather than limiting users to a single time for each dose, we let them set a timeframe in which they want to receive reminders until they've actually taken their dose, providing more flexibility.","Our first iterations experimented with different methods of entering multiple times. However, they were overwhelming and not easily accessible.","After several iterations, we landed on a final design that mimics the interface of standard clock apps. This not only leverages existing standards for inputting times, but also matches users' mental models of when to take their medications. It also clearly communicates the system's state and the user's previous entries, improving usability.","We recognized that with any reminder system, there's a risk of \"notification fatigue,\" where users might dismiss a prompt without thinking. This creates an inaccurate medication history and defeats the core purpose of the app.","To solve this, we aimed to design a logging experience that promoted mindful confirmation, encouraging users to be present and intentional when recording that they've taken their medication. By designing the logging interaction to require more than a simple, thoughtless tap, we'd be building a safeguard against accidental or premature logging.","We first experimented with some different types of interactions that were more involved than simply tapping a button.","During user testing, we found that users felt the dragging interaction was more engaging.","We also decided to change the direction of the dragging interaction every time to prevent users from building a habit of doing the same motion over and over again.

For a project on pervasive computing, my team and I tackled this challenge, exploring how an ecosystem of smart devices could transform the stressful travel experience into confidence.","As a UX Researcher and Designer, I conducted user research to pinpoint the core drivers of traveler stress. Using these insights, I then led the design of our solution, AirPorter, from initial concepts and prototypes to the final system demo.","problem","Our project began by exploring a broad and universally understood problem space: the stress and anxiety of air travel. This could involve anything from the rush to pack, to long security lines, to the fear of a last-minute gate change.","The initial scope was wide and full of possibilities. We knew our first step wasn't to try and solve everything at once, but to conduct user research to narrow this broad feeling of \"stress\" into specific, actionable pain points.","user research","To narrow the scope of our problem, we conducted user research to find the root causes of airport anxiety.","Observing 5 participants to understand how they navigate the airport and why","Uncovering 14 participants' behaviors, emotions, and values regarding airports","Discovering key pain points 120 participants face when traveling in airports","key insight #1","of survey respondents list security procedures, flight delays/cancellations, and navigation as key challenges","\"While the boarding information was displaying the correct gate in this instance, since I received the email that said that my gate was changed, I didn't trust the information displayed in the airport.","Generally speaking, I usually trust the information here, but this time I didn't because of the email I received.\"","— Cultural Probe Participant","key insight #2","of survey respondents experience stress at the airport, regardless of how often they've flown before","Travelers' Stress, Based on Flying Frequency","key insight #3","\"Truthfully, my mom led us through this entire airport experience. I would have been extremely lost otherwise. I was nervous but trusted my mom.\"","Technology Used to Assist Travel in Airports","redefined problem statement","Our user research insights allowed us to move from a vague problem space to a specific, actionable one. We were now trying to answer:","ideation","Based on our research, our ideal user is a tech-savvy travelers who would benefit from precise and timely flight updates, schedule reminders, and airport navigation assistance.","These include:","Travelers who fly infrequently and are unfamiliar with airports","Travelers who are running late and need immediate and accurate information","Travelers who find comfort in planning ahead","To answer our \"How Might We\" question, we first brainstormed many different ideas, and then decided to build upon 3 distinct concepts. Each concept was designed to test a different approach to solving the core problems of uncertainty and lack of control.","We created low-fidelity prototypes and storyboards for each then used user enactments to test them with 14 participants.","Concept #1","Based on their flight information, users would receive personalized reminders for when to leave for the airport, get in line for TSA, etc.","If a user is running late and misses their flight, they're automatically rebooked onto a new flight, and a new itinerary and ticket are sent to them.","Users appreciate assistance in executing decisions, but users want to maintain their agency and not have a system make decisions for them.","Provide users with the information they need to make informed choices. Don't automate important decisions for them.","Concept #2","For users who are running late, they can pay to use a fast pass for TSA lines and/or a driverless car to quickly take them to their gate.","Users value features that offer them a sense of privilege and control within the airport, even if they cost more. They believe their flight is more important and worth the extra money.","For users who are running late, offer paid options that increase their chances of making it to their flight. Only process payments after the service was successful to prevent financial loss and confusion.","Concept #3","Smart robots guide users throughout the airport, acting as the responsible friend that's on top of everything.","While the idea of smart robots is exciting, they'd likely make the already busy airport environment even worse.","Prioritize solutions that don't contribute to the crowded airport environment, for both users and surrounding travelers.","Design Rationale","Using the feedback from our user testing, we defined our solution: an IoT ecosystem.","The system combines 2 key components that work in tandem:","This infrastructure allows the app to provide precise, real-time, location-aware updates and guidance once the user is inside the airport","This serves as the user's central hub to access information for planning and navigating through their entire airport experience","Users are often rushing in the airport because they didn't plan to leave for the airport early enough. So, we wanted to send users reminders for when to leave for the airport to set them up for success later on.","However, in the edge case where a user doesn't leave for the airport until the very last second, they would get overloaded with notifications counting down the time, which could be overwhelming during an already stressful situation.","To solve this issue, we decided to display the information in a Live Activity notification. This format helps visualize the user's journey from when the leave for the airport all the way to when they board the plane.","For our 1st iteration, we tried a straightforward design with a linear line to track the users progress, as well as time estimates for the next step. However, I thought the progress line wasn't clear in showing how far along the user was, with the overall design lacking clear visual hierarchy.","The final design implements a progress tracker with clear visual cues for where the user is, what they've completed, and the steps remaining.","The use of color in the Live Activity also helps to visually reinforce the urgency being conveyed.","To empower users and give them a sense of control, we designed the app's home screen to be adaptive, always showing the most relevant information and the next clear choice.","We decided to center the page around the information most relevant to users in the midst of their journey:","User's Status","User's Next Step","Flight Details","To show details about a user's next step, I explored different options to convey information concisely.","For the final designs, I decided on a card design that made each of the user's options clear and distinct. The cards have a flexible layout that allows for consistent designs for both paid and unpaid options, and the visual hierarchy prioritizes the timing information, which is the most important piece for users.","When users have time to explore the airport, we wanted provide recommendations that took into consideration time constraints.","Initially, we designed recommendations as a single list of options, ordered by distance. However, this could lead to decision fatigue as users are bombarded by options.","To address this, I decided to use tabs to group recommendations, chunking them into manageable pieces and minimizing cognitive load. Now, users can narrow their search down and quickly find whatever they want.","final designs","When travelers connect to AirPorter's network of beacons, AirPorter provides users real-time updates and turn-by-turn navigation to help users make it to their flight on time. If users are running behind, they can access premium services to help them save time and catch their flight.","Users receive real-time updates and notifications about flight status, gate changes, and security wait times, ensuring they are always equipped with the information needed to make informed decisions.","Once at the airport, the app uses its connection to the beacon network to provide turn-by-turn navigation, helping users find their gate or amenities without stress","In stressful situations, users can access premium Fast Pass and Smart Car services directly through the app to save time and ensure they make their flight.","reflection","Conduct additional user tests in actual airports and travel scenarios to measure how effective each feature is when in a hectic environment.","Expand designs beyond smartphones to include devices like smart watches and airport kiosks to promote broader usability and increase adoption.","Explore how to tailor info and notifications to better integrate into users' travel plans, taking into account factors such as preferred arrival time and accessibility needs.","While our group identified many potential areas for improvement within airports, we weren't confident about the direction we should take until we conducted more user research and testing. After we narrowed down on the problem, we also weren't sure of what elements of our IoT system should be made of. We needed to test multiple solutions to figure out which solutions best addressed user needs, as well as which types of technologies existed within users' comfort zones.","Since the product we were developing was an entire IoT system, it involved a lot of moving components interacting with each other. Verbally explaining our ideas was too confusing, and creating hi-fidelity prototypes would be too time consuming; lo-fidelity prototypes were our most useful tool. Lo-fidelity prototypes provided just enough context to make it easy to visualize how different ideas might be implemented while not being too time-consuming to create.","more projects to check out","back to top pan_tool_alt","Check out my projects","B-Stock","Medi","AirPorter","Nissan Leaf","more","resume","© 2025 Angelica Wang"],"codeblock":[],"url":"/airporter"}}
